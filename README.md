# Ankush's dotfiles

I've fallen in love with the idea of extremely customizing my work environment, both my dev box (OS X) and production boxes (Linux). This repo is essentially forked from [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/) with a lot of un-ncessary stuff deleted and personal config added.

## Installation
```sh
curl -sSL dot.ankush.io | bash -s
```
Could it *get* any simpler?
