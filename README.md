# Ankush does dotfiles


I've fallen in love with the idea of extremely customizing my work environment, both my dev box (OS X) and production boxes (Linux). This repo is essentially forked from [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/) with a lot of un-ncessary stuff deleted and personal config added.

## Installation
```sh
curl -sSL dot.ankush.io | bash -s
```
Could it *get* any simpler?

## Thanks
All thanks goes out to [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman).
